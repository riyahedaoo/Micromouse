# Micromouse

This code is for an autonomous self-contained bot on ROS to be simulated
on Gazebo, Micromouse, which can get to the centre of a maze in the shortest possible time. A
micromouse essentially comprises of a drive motor or motors to move it; a steering and turning
method and sensors to detect the presence or absence of maze walls which has to be
specified in the URDF and sensors or control logic to oversee the action of the rest and keep
the vehicle 'on track' or to solve the maze
